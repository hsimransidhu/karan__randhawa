# Truck Mechanic Website

This is a website made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have created this website for my friend who is a truck mechanic. I am still working on improving this website and have not added any backend functionality in it yet.

JUST FOR FUN!!!

The website is a static site that showcases the services and expertise of my friend in truck mechanics. It includes various sections such as:
